# ITV Kidney Disease Prediction using CNN & VGG16

A Deep Learning based Kidney Disease Prediction System developed using TensorFlow/Keras and VGG16 architecture.  
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Transfer Learning to classify kidney disease from medical images.

The model is deployed using a Flask web application where users can upload kidney scan images and get real-time predictions.
